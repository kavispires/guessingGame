### How to play

You have 5 chances to guess a number from 1 to 100.

When you make a guess, the game will tell if you if you should guess a higher or a lower number, as well if you are close (hot) or far (cold) from the secret number.

Up and Down arrows also remind you of previous guesses: if they should be higher or lower and the colors of the arrows show how close you were with that number.

If you are stuck, you may press the _hint_ button. It will give you three possible numbers, making everything much easier.
